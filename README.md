# CND Demo Examples

**Maintainers:** [Okteto](https://github.com/okteto)

This repo contains CND Demo examples for different use cases and programming languages.

Go to [CND](https://github.com/okteto/cnd) to know more about CND and Cloud Native Development.

## Prerequisites

The examples included in this repository work in any kubernetes cluster. Cloud Native Development provides more value in remote kubernetes clusters, but in order to make it simple to follow this guide, we recommend to use Docker for Mac (with Kubernetes support) or [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube).
